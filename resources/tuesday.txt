Purpose:
Tuesday's activities aim to shift from understanding the problem to generating potential solutions. The day is dedicated to exploring and remixing ideas to create actionable solutions that address the challenges and opportunities identified on Monday. This process involves looking at existing ideas for inspiration and sketching out new, detailed solutions.

Key Tasks:
Review and Remix Ideas:

Look at existing ideas and solutions within your industry or other fields for inspiration.
Discuss what has worked and what hasnâ€™t in similar contexts to stimulate creativity.
Sketch Solutions:

Individually sketch detailed solutions on paper. This encourages deep thinking and helps generate a variety of ideas.
Each sketch should be a concrete, executable solution rather than a vague concept.
Gather Inspiration:

Review industry benchmarks, competitor products, and relevant case studies.
Discuss with team members or look into past projects to gather different perspectives and ideas.
Guidance and Tips:
Remix and Improve:

Don't reinvent the wheel; look at successful ideas and think about how they can be adapted or improved for your context.
Use existing solutions as a foundation, then build on them to better suit your needs.
Encourage Diverse Thinking:

Make sure everyone on the team contributes, especially those from different disciplines.
Diverse perspectives can lead to innovative solutions that a more homogeneous group might overlook.
Sketching Techniques:

Use simple, clear sketches to convey ideas. Focus on the key elements that make your solution effective.
Label parts of your sketches to explain their function and importance.
Evaluate Ideas:

Discuss the feasibility and potential impact of each sketch.
Be open to combining elements from different sketches to create a stronger overall solution.
Stay Focused:

Keep the long-term goal in mind while brainstorming and sketching.
Ensure that all ideas align with the overall objective of your sprint.
Use Feedback:

If possible, gather quick feedback on your sketches from potential users or stakeholders.
Use this feedback to refine and improve your ideas before finalizing them.
By following these steps and tips, you'll generate a range of innovative solutions that can be further refined and tested as you move forward in the sprint process.
