Purpose
Monday is all about setting the foundation for your sprint. The activities today aim to:

Clearly understand the long-term goal of your project.
Identify the key challenges and opportunities ahead.
Establish the direction and focus for the sprint week.
Ensure that everyone involved has a unified vision and understanding of the project’s objectives.
Key Tasks
Set the Long-Term Goal:

Define where you want to be in six months, a year, or even five years.
Focus on the impact you want to create and ensure it is specific and measurable.
Example questions: "What would success look like?", "What is the ultimate objective of this project?"
Create a Map of the Problem Space:

Diagram the journey from the starting point to the end goal.
Identify major steps and milestones.
Highlight potential obstacles and key decision points.
List Critical Questions:

Ask crucial questions to understand potential pitfalls and challenges.
Transform fears into actionable questions.
Example questions: "Will users understand our value proposition?", "Can we deliver the core feature set in time?"
Guidance and Tips
Setting Realistic Yet Ambitious Goals
Be Ambitious but Practical: Your long-term goal should stretch your capabilities but remain achievable. Think big but stay grounded in reality.
Specific and Measurable: Vague goals lead to vague outcomes. Ensure your goal is clear and measurable. For instance, "Increase user retention by 20%" is better than "Improve user engagement."
Align with Vision: Your goal should align with the overall vision and mission of your project or company. It should contribute meaningfully to the broader objectives.
Creating an Effective Problem Map
Keep It Simple: A clear and straightforward map is more effective than a complicated one. Focus on the major steps and critical points.
Use Visuals: Diagrams, flowcharts, and sketches can help visualize the problem space better than text alone. Use tools like sticky notes or whiteboards for flexibility.
Iterate Quickly: Don’t aim for perfection on the first try. Create an initial map and refine it as you gain more insights.
Asking the Right Questions
Transform Fears into Questions: List down the fears or risks associated with the project and convert them into questions. This will help in proactively addressing potential issues.
Prioritize Questions: Not all questions are equally important. Prioritize them based on their impact and the likelihood of occurrence.
Be Specific: Avoid vague questions. Specific questions lead to specific answers, which are more actionable. For instance, instead of asking "Is this feature necessary?", ask "How does this feature enhance the user experience?"
Practical Advice
Engage with Stakeholders: Even if you are running the sprint alone, gather input from key stakeholders. This could be through quick meetings, surveys, or informal chats.
Document Everything: Keep detailed notes of discussions, decisions, and rationales. This documentation will be invaluable throughout the sprint week.
Stay Flexible: While having a plan is crucial, be prepared to adapt as new information and insights emerge.
