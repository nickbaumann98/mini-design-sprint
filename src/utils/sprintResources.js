    prompt: "Welcome to your mini design sprint! This tool will guide you through a rapid, focused process to solve a critical problem and prototype a solution. Today, we will start by defining the long-term goal for your project. This goal should be specific and measurable, serving as a guiding light throughout the sprint. Once defined, we'll identify 2-3 critical questions that address potential challenges in achieving this goal. Let's get started!"

Each panel should represent a key step or moment in your solution: the problem, the main action, and the result. Describe each panel in detail, focusing on what the user sees and does. Let's dive in!"
